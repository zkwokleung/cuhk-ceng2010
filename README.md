# CUHK CENG2010 Digital Logic Design Laboratory  


This repository contained all the VHDL codes written by myself when I was studying the course CENG2010 in 2021. If you are also working on the labs and the homework for this course, please feel free to take a look at it.

## Lab 5


```diff
- wrong waveform, -5 marks  
```


Remember you need to start the waveform at ext_input = 1.  
What a stupid reason.  


## Homework

My version of the homework is not the simplest working solution. I have seen people score 100 with a single file. I aim to make it as structural-perfect as possible by separating the concerns. This project could be painful to read for beginners, but on the other hand, it will be much clearer which part of the code is doing what.
