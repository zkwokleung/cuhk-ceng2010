# CUHK CENG2010 Digital Logic Design Laboratory

This repository contained all the VHDL codes written by myself when I was studying the course CENG2010 in 2021. If you are also working on the labs and the homework for this course, please feel free to take a look at it.

```
Remember you need to start the waveform at ext_input = 1
